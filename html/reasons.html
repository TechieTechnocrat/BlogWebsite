    <div id="name">-By Sonal</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Writing for SEO isn’t easy. Google changes its algorithms time and again, and along with that chances of your
            blog appearing on top also changes.
            This article will guide you through what you must be doing wrong while blogging and why you should primarily
            focus on writing a good blog.
            <br>
            Premium quality content is always associated with more web traffic and more brand awareness. And before
            jumping into how you can use SEO based content writing to make your brand flourish you need to
            understand-<br>
            • What is SEO?<br>
            • What is a good blog?<br>
            • How are a good blog and a good ranking interrelated?<br>
        </p>
        <h2>What does SEO mean? </h2>
        <p>Technically, SEO stands for search engine optimization, and that is basically a process of upgrading your
            website rank in terms of both quality and quantity. Put it differently, SEO is a practice of describing
            strategies with aim of increasing web traffic on your page. <br>
            If you are a student searching for homework, or a fashion enthusiast searching for tips and tricks, your
            first step is googling. Most of us read articles that are on the top rank. According to a study conducted by
            Backlinko, only 0.78% of Google searchers click on results from the 2nd page
            Only a few blogs out of hundreds appear on the first page and that is because of their anatomy. Good,
            relevant blog posts will always be on top and this is because they contain keywords, appropriate search
            terms.
            SEO works on the principles of organic search results and SERPs. The keywords you mention in your blog, the
            links you provide, also social metrics are very important factors to boost your SEO ranking in almost every
            search engine.
            <br>
            And, to write content for SEO, you need to ensure that-<br>
            • A title should include the main keyword phrase<br>
            • All the major keywords should be distributed all over your blog post<br>
            • Keywords, LSI keywords should be present in different subheadings of your blog post.<br>
            • Meta links on the webpage should be provided with keywords. (This is part of an on-site SEO ranking)<br>
            All these points mentioned above will play a major role in determining the rank of your site.
            <br>

        </p>
        <h2> What type of Content is considered as good blog? </h2>
        <p>
            Blogging has helped a lot of people build traffic and achieve good brand awareness.
            But obviously, if your blog will not have a good ranking and people won’t read your content then it is
            impossible for your brand to evolve and flourish.
            And to make your website presence stand out, you need to follow some strategies to get your content ranked
            higher

            <br>
        <h2> Streamline your content- </h2>

        1) Include key phrases in your title- The best-performing pages have the keyword closest to the beginning of the
        heading. So, prefer keeping keywords at the beginning of your title
        <br>2) Scatter keywords in your blog post- Include keywords a few times more in the article but remember not to
        stuff your content with it. It should not break the flow and appear absolutely normal.
        <br>3) Try to increase the word limit of your content- Almost all the pages appearing on the top search has
        almost over 1000-2000 words.
        <br>4) Polish readability of your content- The content should have a low readability score. Do not go deep into
        technicalities unless it’s a technical topic; try to use easy words so that even a 6th-grade student understands
        it.
        <br>5) Physically appealing- Your content should have small paragraphs, bullets, images, and stats. A properly
        formatted document will be appealing and people will view your content.
        Blogging is good for SEO because it has many factors that can contribute to ranking. When you create a good blog
        and update it regularly with topics relevant to your audience, automatically your brand will perform well in the
        search engines.
        <b><br> So, here are the main Top 7 Reasons a Good Blog Improves Ranking— </b> <br>
        <h3>1) Top-notch content-- Fresh and up-to-date </h3>
        Search engines give more preference to recently updated fresh content.
        Blogging gives you an option to regularly update your content and therefore keeps your website fresh and new.
        Google will not deliver such obsolete information to the user.
        For example, if you land on a page that was updated 2 years ago, statistics and data might change since the last
        update. And the information you read will not be reliable.
        So, keeping this in mind regularly updated websites are ranked higher than outdated ones.


        <h3>2) Keywords </h3>
        When you include keywords in your titles and headings that will yield you a good response and rank. But if you
        stuff way too many keywords, it will break the natural flow of your data and hence look shoddy. Nowadays
        keywords hold importance and should be included wherever necessary should serve the purpose.
        Blogging also helps you target the Longtail keyword, which holds paramount importance. Targeting long-tail
        keywords in your heading is not possible but including them in your blog gives more keywords to google and hence
        drives more traffic. This in turn will improve your ranking.


        <br>
        <h3>3) Internal Linking</h3>
        This is the easiest way to get yourself ranked higher. Internal links on your website drive users from one page
        to another. This is a very important way to give a clear idea to visitors about where a particular topic is
        placed.
        For e.g.-
        A user visits your page of reviews of some products. Say he wants to know the price comparison and not the
        detailed review. If your page will have a table of contents with proper internal linking, the user will stay and
        read the content easily.
        Failing to provide internal links might be the reason for him to leave the page and open another website.
        Hence Internal linking in a blog also matters and is responsible for good ranking.
        <h3>4) Backlinking</h3>
        Google needs to authorize your website and backlinking will help you do so. If you are linked with famous brands
        that automatically gives you an upper hand of popularity and authenticity.
        But be mindful of-
        • If you paid the website, ensure that they use a no-follow designation.
        • Work only with prevalent and well-known brands and links from them should serve some purpose. If these links
        will have nothing to do with your blog’s topic, do not include them.

        <h3>5) Bond with the audience </h3>
        A good blog is always of premium quality and is more engaging. The content has the capability of interacting
        with the visitors properly.
        When a website gets more traffic and visitors, that is proof that your website is good and interactive. Google
        understands that this website and is liked and hence improves its ranking.
        This also increases the average time spent on your website which is also an important factor that Google
        considers for good writing.

        <h3>6) Images and videos</h3>
        Images and videos make your content more appealing to the eyes. And that could be one of the reasons to increase
        the average stay time of visitors on your web page.
        Also, images when compiled in a blog give more reasons for search engines to rank you higher. One more thing
        that affects ranking is the alt-text feature of the image. This will serve two main purposes-
        • SEO
        • Information to those who are not able to see images
        Videos are also responsible to drive more people. An informative video with proper tags and caption will give a
        clear idea to visitors that what is happening on the web page.
        <h3>7) Social Media</h3>
        You must be wondering why many blog websites are linked to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. This is primarily
        because Google favors social media search results as well.
        You can easily enhance your SEO ranking through these social media listings.

        </p>
        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
        <p>
            The content that grabs the audience's attention can be considered good quality content. A Good blog will
            always attract more people and develop good relations with the people you want to reach. Hence improves your
            ranking.
