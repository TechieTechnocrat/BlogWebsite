    <div id="content">
        <p>I am a student at Vit Bhopal. This website displays some of my writings which i wrote in order to represent
            my wrting style.After working for already existing content-based marketing agency, I realized I wanted my
            own space of writing. Also due to prior experience I have built the strong foundation required for creative
            writing. I have learned that Content plays a major role in driving traffic to a website. </p>
        <p>I do have a good grip and understanding of how to write a good blog for readers online. I have learned the
            concept of digital marketing and how does SEO rank Optimization work. Also, I am a tech enthusiast and I
            love to read about politics. I cite my opinions very strongly related to any controversial political debate.
            And I would be able to map my thoughts on paper as well and write a good article in the current affair
            genre.
            Itâ€™s worth mentioning that I am a student with good knowledge about the teenage audience. I do understand
            the concept of sustainable fashion for our age. The Consumer audience our age wants to know more about
            affordable fashion and I do understand it and hence I would be able to write good content that will drive
            the audience to my website.</p>
        <p> I would also like to mention that I am a cyber student with good knowledge about the stories and blogs
            required to engage the audience.
            In future, someday I would like to host my own website. Till then, I will keep on working with it to make it
            better.
            I wanted to upskill my writing and that's what intrigued my interest in creating my own website and pen down
            my opinions. Thankyou!</p>
